    Introducing the concept of incentivising users based on engagement (likes, comments , referrals, daily logins, etc.) through Web3 technologies. In the age of Web3, user engagement is being redefined. The integration of blockchain technology allows for secure and transparent reward systems that can significantly enhance the user experience by rewarding them virtual points which are converted into our native token sparkz.

# overview:
  - The Trading of posts will help in decentralising of the platform where user will have the ownership of the post which can be transfered to other users 
  
  - Token conversion ratio will be based on the current market cap of the token whereas the user engagement points are fixed 
  
  - The daily streak feature will increase the user retention of the platform as we will reward on certain milestones of streaks 
  
  - Also the referral program will attract more users to the platform


# Key Features Of Our Native Token:
  - Tokens will hold monetary values it will be listed on various decentralised excahnge with some initial liquidity.
  - The tokens can be used within the platform for buying and selling posts.
  - The tokens can also be used for decentralised voting (DAO proposal).Where user can vote for the feature/changes they want for the platform based on their token ownership this will help in the decentralisation of the platform.
  - Advertisers can utilise our tokens for getting discount on our advertisement space, which will then contribute to the liquidity of the token.

    
# Advantages Of Using Decentralized Social Media:
  - **Increased User Privacy** : Decentralized platforms provide enhanced privacy, ensuring that user data is not controlled by a central authority, thus reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized use. 

  - **User Rewards** : Users will receive cryptocurrency rewards for valuable engagement, creating a symbiotic relationship between the platform and its active community.

  - **Creator Incentives** : Creators are empowered with the opportunity to earn rewards based on the quality and impact of their content, fostering a strong content creation environment.

  - **Censorship Resistance** : Content on a decentralized platform is resistant to censorship, allowing diverse voices and opinions to thrive without the risk of being silenced.

  - **Community Ownership** : By decentralizing ownership and decision-making, the platform empowers its community, fostering a sense of ownership and deeper engagement.

## Setup MongoDB URI

  **a. Access MongoDB Atlas:** Go to the MongoDB Atlas website and sign in to your account (or create a new one if you haven't already).
  
  **b. Create a New Cluster:** If you don't have a cluster already, create a new one by following the prompts. Make sure to choose the appropriate settings for your needs.
  
  **c. Whitelist IP Addresses:** In the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, navigate to "Network Access" and add your IP address to the whitelist. This allows your applications to connect to the cluster.
  
  **d. Create a Database User:** Go to "Database Access" in the dashboard and create a new database user with appropriate permissions for your application.
  
  **e. Get Connection String (URI):** Go back to the main dashboard and click on "Connect" for your cluster. Choose "Connect your application" and copy the connection string (URI) provided.
  
  **f. Replace Placeholder Values:** Replace the placeholder values in the connection string with your actual database user credentials, database name, and any other options you need.

## Example MongoDB URI:
  ```bash
  mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  ```

## Future Scope
  - Implementing Sign Up and Log In without connecting the wallet to attract people that don't have any expereience in crypto and introducing them to crypto without overwhelming them.
  - Converting the posts into a NFT and selling that NFT on a market place.
  - Create a trending page using various NLP and Machine Learing algorithms to analyze user preferences and recomending them posts.
